This repository contains the MiRS software package. There are several files available:
* MiRS User Manual
* MiRS Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document
* The official delivery memo describing the satellites that MiRS may process, the official products which are generated, as well as changes made relative to the previous release of MiRS.
* The main package: a compressed tar file containing all the necessary source codes, scripts, configuration and ancillary data files.

Once the tar file is uncompressed and unpacked, the README file under <installation_directory>/src/README can be referred to for more information on how to build and run MiRS.

The full package (with data) from:
https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/data/mirs_download/mirs_v11r10_r111024075_oper_20240315.tar.gz
